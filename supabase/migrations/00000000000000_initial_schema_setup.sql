/*
  # Initial Schema Setup for Course Management System

  1. New Tables
    - `courses`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `name` (text)
      - `faculty` (text)
      - `instructor` (text)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `students`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `name` (text)
      - `email` (text, unique)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `enrollments`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `course_id` (uuid, foreign key)
      - `student_id` (uuid, foreign key)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for authenticated users
